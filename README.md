This repository contains SQL projects, the databases used for the projects saved here as db files. I have used Python and Sqlite3 for all the projects.
Used Python for exploratory analysis of  the data that is retrieved from the database and also used Sqlite3 features for easy access of database. SQLite 3 which is an in process Python library that implements a self-contained, serverless zero configuration transactional SQL database engine.
The projects included in this repository are:
- Chicago public schools, Chicago crime and Chicago socioeconomic data analysis 
- Employee database
- Progresscard analysis of Chicago schools
- Northwind sales analysis using SQL

Please do not make any changes in this repository. 
I have included in each colab notebook the source from where the database files were orginally taken from. 
Happy coding !!
